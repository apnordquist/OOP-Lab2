Lab 2: Inheritance
Date: February 3, 2024
Author: Adam Nordquist

This is a lab that I completed for my Object Oriented Programming class. It reads a provided txt file to create a list of Employee objects and separates them into three sub-classes: Salaried, Wage, and Part-time. Four methods are conducted to complete the lab and were created under the Main class. 
  First, AvgPay() which sum the each emplyee's pay with a GetPay() method and divides it by the number of employees. 
  Second, HighestWage() sorts through the employee list comparing each object of the Wage subclass with a highest pay variable to see which employee has the highest wage.
  Third, LowestSalary() sorts through the employee list comparing each object of the Salary subclass with a lowest pay variable (set to 999999 to start) to find the employee with the lowest salary.
  Finally, three methods are used return a percantage share each subclass has of the total number employees and create an overall composition of the company.
